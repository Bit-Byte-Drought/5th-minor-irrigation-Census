# 5th-minor-irrigation-Census(2013-14)

This has all the data sets regarding the MI census.  
Okay for all of you who are working on the correlation and cleaning process (actually everyone) make a note of all the attributes from all the data sets in this readme file.  
Now that we have all the attributes from all the data sets try pulling out attributes which can give about a meaningful correlation  and put it up on the group.  
And then Aditya will carry over pulling all the attributes which have been made up with meaningful correlations into a single data frame and plot graphs of all of them.  
Caution!! - Please note that all the data sets do not have values for all the districts. There are cases where some of the datasets have only certain districts and not all, so please consider that when you make correlations.
